# EstateEase Property Search Application

This is a client-side web application built with React.js that allows users to search for properties based on various criteria. It also provides detailed property information, a favourites list, and is designed to be responsive across devices.

## Project Overview

EstateEase is a property search application that enables users to easily browse and filter through property listings, save favorites, and explore detailed property information. It provides a seamless experience for users looking for their next home or investment property, built to demonstrate proficiency in HTML5, React JS, and responsive web design practices.

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Search:** Search properties by type (house, flat, any), price range, number of bedrooms, date added, and postcode area.
*   **Enhanced Form:** Uses React Widgets for consistent, reliable, and accessible form elements.
*   **Detailed Results:** Displays search results in an effective and pleasant manner, including a picture, short description, and price.
*   **Property Details Page:** Each property has a dedicated page with a large image, thumbnail images, a short description, a long description, a floor plan, and Google Maps integration.
*   **React Tabs:** Uses React Tabs to display the property description, floor plan, and map.
*   **Favorites:** Allows users to save properties to a favorites list via drag and drop or a "favorite" button. The user can also remove properties from the favorites list or clear all of them at once. The favourites are stored in the browser's local storage.
*   **Responsive Design:** Implements a responsive layout using hand-written media queries and flex/grid layout for both the search page and the property details page.
*   **Aesthetic Design:** The design has a clear visual hierarchy, proper alignment and grouping, a consistent color scheme, and effective use of visual elements.
*   **Security:** Includes client-side security measures with HTML encoding to protect against attacks.
*   **Contact Us Form:** Includes a contact form for users to send messages to EstateEase, which uses Bootstrap for the form elements.
*  **Service Banner:** A banner describing the services that this website provides, and also uses bootstrap for responsiveness.
*   **Fully Client-Side:** The application is designed to run completely on the client-side (no server-side code needed) and can be run directly in a browser.
*   **JSON Data:** Uses a JSON file to store property data that is then rendered by the application.
*   **Attractive Footer:** Stylish footer to provide company information, social media links, copyright and contact information.
